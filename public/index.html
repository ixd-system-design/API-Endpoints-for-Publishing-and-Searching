        <h1>Ready-Only API</h1>
        <p>This page fetches records from MongoDB by means of a NodeJS <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> API and the <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> library. You will need to add your connection string to the environment to  make it work. You may adjust / adapt it to work with a data collection of your choosing. The purpose of a read-only API is to allow simple publishing of content. It does not allow us to Edit, Update, or Delete records. (We will cover that in a different example).</p>
